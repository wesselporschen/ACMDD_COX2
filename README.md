# ACMDD_COX2
This is the GitHub repository hosting the assignment involving the analysis of human cyclooxygenase-2 using computational drug discovery tools as part of the course *Advanced Computational Methods in Drug Discovery: AI and Physics Based simulations* for the MSc program Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences at Leiden University, 2024.

## Notebooks
The Jupyter notebooks containing the workflows are largely adapted from https://github.com/jesperswillem/CBR_teaching, and https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd. They involve the following topics:

1. Introduction to Bioinformatics: study of the human COX-2 protein, sequence alignment, intra- and interspecies similarity.
2. Machine Learning: using public (CHEMBL) bioactivity data to train classification and regression models to predict bioactivity in new ligands. 
3. Docking: using AutoDock Vina to perform molecular docking of (salicylic acid-like) ligands on an experimental structure of COX-2 (PDB: *5F1A*). 
4. Docking with AlphaFold: performing molecular docking on a COX-2 structure produced by the AlphaFold 2 model, and using interaction fingerprints (Prolif) validate docking results.
